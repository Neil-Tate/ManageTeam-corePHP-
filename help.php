<h1>Welcome to ManageTeam!</h1>

<p>Wouldn't it be nice if there was a system that told you what you team's next objectives should be? Using AI ManageTeam analyses all your tickets (serviceNOW, Sales Force, Google feedback etc) and suggests what your next 3 objectives should be.
<br/>- Ingest tickets, sales force customer feedback and get recommended objectives.
<br/>- Reports: See outcomes people are happier about your "profiles" feature since you fixed it, people are logging less tickets since you fixed it.
<br/>- OKR Progress: OKR chart maps your progress against the 5 Pillars of OKRs to ensure you achieve your objective.

<p>Start by clicking <b>"add team"</b> and following the guided steps.
<br/><br/>
<h3>5 Pillars of OKRs</h3>
<p><b>Objectives Pillar:</b> Number of objectives defined that are complete. (3 per team).
<p><b>Key results Pillar:</b> Number of key results defined that are complete.
<p><b>Target Pillar:</b> How many teams are updating their targets.
